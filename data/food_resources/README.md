#### Neighborhood food retail and access
This dataset is derived from the Neighborhood Food Retail in Philadelphia report. The report, and accompanying online resource gallery, looks at neighborhood availability of "high-produce supply stores? (e.g., supermarkets, produce stores, farmers? markets) in relation to ?low-produce supply stores? (like dollar stores, pharmacies, and convenience stores). The report and online gallery may be found at http://foodfitphilly.org/NeighborhoodFoodRetail/
