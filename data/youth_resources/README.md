### Playstreets Locations

* https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/playstreets-locations

> The streets (at the center of platystreet blocks) involved in the PPR Playstreets Program. This program closes designated streets to traffic so that kids have a safe place to play when school is out. A key feature of the program are the nutritious meals and snacks provided to children. This is important during the summer months when school meals are not available.


* Data
	* CSV - PPR_Playstreets_Locations.csv
	* GeoJSON - PPR_Playstreets_Locations.geojson


* Temporal Range
	* Looks like just 2020
	* But this program has been extant for a number of years (from various news reports) - is historical data available?
